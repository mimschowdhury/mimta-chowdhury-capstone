# Project Title
The Toronto Brew? 6ixcafes

## Overview ☕️

6ixCafes is a platform designed for coffee lovers in Toronto to easily find and keep track of the best cafés in the city. It addresses the pain point of having to look up multiple resources (Google Maps, blogTO, Instagram, etc.) to find a good café. This website will filter cafés based on the best study spots, ambiance, and coffee quality.

### Problem Space

Finding a good café can be a tedious process involving multiple websites and reviews. People often search through Google Maps, blogs, and social media to find cafes, but there isn’t a single platform that consolidates this information and lets users filter cafés by study-friendly spaces, great ambiance, and quality coffee.

### User Profile

- Coffee drinkers who:
	- Are looking for a café close to their current or future location
    - Want to find the best places for studying or relaxing
	- Want to track cafés they have visited and rate them

### Features

	- Find nearby cafés based on the user’s current or provided location
	- Filter cafés based on criteria such as study spots, ambiance, and coffee quality
	- Rate cafés out of 5 coffee cups for ambiance, study-friendliness, and coffee
	- Update ratings for cafes based on future visits
	- View and filter visited cafés by rating, location, etc.
